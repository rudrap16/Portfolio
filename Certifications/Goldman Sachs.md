# 2. GOLDMAN SACHS - VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP

# Goldman Sachs Software Engineering - IT Security Governance Simulation üéâüîê  

## Overview  
As part of **Goldman Sachs‚Äôs Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on **Forage**, I took on the role of a **governance analyst**, responsible for assessing **IT security vulnerabilities** and suggesting improvements.  

During this simulation, I analyzed **password security risks** and identified the use of an **outdated hashing algorithm** by successfully cracking passwords with **Hashcat**. Based on my findings, I proposed **security uplifts** to enhance password protection.  

## Key Contributions  
‚úÖ **Security Assessment** - Analyzed company password policies for vulnerabilities.  
‚úÖ **Hashcat Usage** - Tested and cracked weak password hashes to demonstrate risks.  
‚úÖ **Memo Report** - Proposed security enhancements, including:  
   - Extending **minimum password length** for stronger security.  
   - Recommending a **dedicated, stronger hashing algorithm**.  

## Technologies & Tools Used  
- **Cybersecurity Analysis**  
- **Hashcat** (Password Cracking)  
- **Governance & Compliance**  
- **Security Best Practices**  

## Key Learnings  
- Importance of **strong password hashing algorithms** in IT security.  
- Hands-on experience with **penetration testing tools** like Hashcat.  
- Writing **security governance reports** with actionable recommendations.  
- Understanding **real-world InfoSec challenges** in large organizations.  

## Acknowledgment  
This experience provided valuable insights into **cybersecurity best practices** and how governance analysts contribute to **enterprise security improvements**. Excited to apply these learnings to future security challenges!
